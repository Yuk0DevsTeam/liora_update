When children continue to misbehave, you can bet 
that one parent isn’t backing the other up.
If you don’t feel supported by your partner in parenting, if you get 
stuck with all the driving or always have to be the one to enforce the rules, 
don’t put all the blame on your partner. Maybe he or she disagrees with what you’re doing. Try asking.
“I g
et the feeling you don’t really agree with my way of handling this. 
Maybe you don’t think I’m interested in your opinion—but I am. I’d really like to hear what you think.”
Parenting is also an excellent place to observe the other side of 
complementarity— polarization. Instead of coming together on certain 
issues, parents push each other further apart. If one is too strict, the other 
may become too lenient. The more one harps at the children, the more the other tries to compensate by being in

2. Pick out one thing that your child fails to do consistently despite fre-
quent reminders. Find a time when you’re both relaxed to talk with the child and say that you bet he or she has a good reason for not doing that something—maybe the child doesn’t think it’s fair for him or her to have to—and that you’d like to hear how the child feels about it. If you’re lucky enough to have your child open up, just listen. Don’t end the convers

Most families have problems not because there’s something wrong 
with them but because they’ve gotten stuck. Families resist change 
even more than individuals because the structure that holds them 
together is supported by the actions of every single family member. That’s 
why systems are stubborn. What we mustn’t forget, though,

in our lives, whether it’s our diet or work habits or listening skills, and we experience a setback, we have a tendency to feel hopeless and give up. Suddenly all the progress we thought we were making seems like an illusion. Maybe if I were reading a book about listening and experienced these setbacks, I would have given up.

 isn’t hard to understand either. 
They’re curious about what goes on in their children’s lives. They want to know if everything is okay. They want to know if their children are doing what they should be doing. They don’t want to be shut out.
Sometimes kids say “nothing” but really do have something to say. 
Maybe you have to show them that you’re really interested to convince them to open up. Asking them about their day and really being prepared to listen shows interest. Honoring their right to
 respond the way they want shows respect as well as interest— interest in them and respect for their

Assistant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of concern about how financial struggles might impact your children, and that’s completely understandable. You want to protect them from anxiety while also being honest about the situation.

When you're ready to talk to them, consider framing the conversation in a way that emphasizes resilience and teamwork as a family. You might say something like, “Sometimes families have to make adjustments to stay strong and together. We’re all going to work through this as a team.” This approach helps them feel involved and reassured that it's a shared journey.

Assistant: It sounds like you're feeling a bit disconnected from yourself since becoming a parent, which is something many parents experience. It's completely normal to go through this transition and to seek ways to rediscover who you are.

What activities or interests do you remember enjoying before becoming a parent? Reflecting on those can be a great starting point. Additionally, carving out even small moments for yourself—whether it's a quiet cup of tea, a short walk, or a favorite hobby—can be beneficial.

How do you feel about the idea of exploring those lost interests or even trying out new ones? This could be a lovely way to reconnect with yourself while also modeling self-care for your children.

User: I want to improve communication with my teenage child, but they always shut me out. How can I build a better relationship with them?
Related context found:  boundaries give teenagers room to explore but keep lines of communication open. What’s the secret of finding the right balance? Listening works wonders.
But it’s not just listening as a passive taking in. It’s making an active 
effort to tune in and hear what your teenager is saying. It’s connecting.

Say that your teenage son never talks to you. Oh, he’ll let you know 
when he needs new sneakers or a ride somewhere, but you miss the talks you used to have when he was younger. Now he’s so sullen. You can write off this uncommunicativeness to adolescence if you like, or you can think of it as part of a circular process.

Recognizing Their Need to Break Away
A major reason for lack of communication between teenagers and parents is the parents’ failure to accept the inevitable: if children are to grow up, they must break away from the older generation. It’s a teenager’s job to criticize his parents. The same children who once looked up to Mommy and Daddy as giants who can do no wrong now look down on them as old fogies who can do nothing right. This dis
Assistant: It sounds like you’re feeling frustrated and perhaps a bit disheartened by the distance you’re experiencing with your teenager. It’s completely natural to want to connect and communicate, especially when it feels like they're shutting you out. 

One effective approach is to focus on creating a safe space for open dialogue. Have you considered initiating conversations in a relaxed environment, perhaps during a shared activity or while doing something they enjoy? This can help lower any barriers they might feel.

Also, tuning into non-verbal cues can be incredibly insightful. Pay attention to their body language and tone; it might give you hints about how they’re feeling. You might ask them open-ended questions or share something personal about your day to encourage them to open up in return.
