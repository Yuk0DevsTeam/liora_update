When children continue to misbehave, you can bet 
that one parent isn’t backing the other up.
If you don’t feel supported by your partner in parenting, if you get 
stuck with all the driving or always have to be the one to enforce the rules, 
don’t put all the blame on your partner. Maybe he or she disagrees with what you’re doing. Try asking.
“I g

Maybe you don’t think I’m interested in your opinion—but I am. I’d really like to hear what you think.”
Parenting is also an excellent place to observe the other side of 
complementarity— polarization. Instead of coming together on certain 
issues, parents push each other further apart. If one is too strict, the other 
may become too lenient. The more one harps at the children, the more the other tries to compensate by being in

2. Pick out one thing that your child fails to do consistently despite fre-
quent reminders. Find a time when you’re both relaxed to talk with the child and say that you bet he or she has a good reason for not doing that something—maybe the child doesn’t think it’s fair for him or her to have to—and that you’d like to hear how the child feels about it. If you’re lucky enough to have your child open up, just listen. Don’t end the convers
Assistant: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and perhaps a bit isolated in your parenting journey right now. It's completely understandable to feel that way when there are disagreements with your partner. 

First, I want to acknowledge your feelings—it's clear that you care deeply about both your family and your relationship, and that shows your dedication as a parent and partner.

Have you had a chance to talk with your partner about why you both disagree on certain parenting decisions? It might help to set aside some time when you’re both relaxed to discuss your perspectives without the heat of the moment. What emotions come up for you when you think about addressing this with your partner?

Most families have problems not because there’s something wrong 
with them but because they’ve gotten stuck. Families resist change 
even more than individuals because the structure that holds them 
together is supported by the actions of every single family member. That’s 
why systems are stubborn. What we mustn’t forget, though,

in our lives, whether it’s our diet or work habits or listening skills, and we experience a setback, we have a tendency to feel hopeless and give up. Suddenly all the progress we thought we were making seems like an illusion. Maybe if I were reading a book about listening and experienced these setbacks, I would have given up.

Assistant: It's completely normal to feel drained while caring for a family, especially when you're juggling various responsibilities. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed, which many caregivers experience at some point. Recognizing that you need help is a strong first step. 

What do you think might be holding you back from asking for help? Sometimes, just sharing your feelings or concerns with someone else can lighten the load a bit.

 isn’t hard to understand either. 
They’re curious about what goes on in their children’s lives. They want to know if everything is okay. They want to know if their children are doing what they should be doing. They don’t want to be shut out.
Sometimes kids say “nothing” but really do have something to say. 
Maybe you have to show them that you’re really interested to convince them to open up. Asking them about their day and really being prepared to listen shows interest. Honoring their right to
 respond the way they want shows respect as well as interest— interest in them and respect for their 
feelings. Children who sense that their parents are interested in hearing what they have to say—as opposed to interrogating or prying—will open up when they’re ready.

Assistant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of worry about your family's financial situation and its impact on your kids, which is completely understandable. You're prioritizing their emotional well-being, and that shows how much you care. 

When talking to your children about finances, think about age-appropriate language. You could start by reassuring them that you are working on things, emphasizing the importance of being a team as a family. You might ask them what they understand about money, gently guiding the conversation without overwhelming them.

But it’s not just listening as a passive taking in. It’s making an active

Recognizing Their Need to Break Away
A major reason for lack of communication between teenagers and parents is the parents’ failure to accept the inevitable: if children are to grow up, they must break away from the older generation. It’s a teenager’s job to criticize his parents. The same children who once looked up to Mommy and Daddy as giants who can do no wrong now look down on them as old fogies who can do nothing right.

Have you noticed any specific moments or topics where they might be more open to talking? Sometimes, creating low-pressure situations can help. What feelings come up for you when you think about approaching them? 

You might also consider trying to engage in shared activities they enjoy, as it can naturally open up opportunities for conversation. Finding ways to listen actively and showing genuine interest in their world, even if it feels like they’re keeping everything private, can make a big difference. What do you think about that approach?
