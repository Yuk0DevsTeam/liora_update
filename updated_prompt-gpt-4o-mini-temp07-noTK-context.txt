When children continue to misbehave, you can bet 
that one parent isn’t backing the other up.
If you don’t feel supported by your partner in parenting, if you get 
stuck with all the driving or always have to be the one to enforce the rules, 
don’t put all the blame on your partner. Maybe he or she disagrees with what you’re doing. Try asking.
“I g
et the feeling you don’t really agree with my way of handling this. 
Maybe you don’t think I’m interested in your opinion—but I am. I’d really like to hear what you think.”
Parenting is also an excellent place to observe the other side of 
complementarity— polarization. Instead of coming together on certain 
issues, parents push each other further apart. If one is too strict, the other 
may become too lenient. The more one harps at the children, the more the other tries to compensate by being in

2. Pick out one thing that your child fails to do consistently despite fre-
quent reminders. Find a time when you’re both relaxed to talk with the child and say that you bet he or she has a good reason for not doing that something—maybe the child doesn’t think it’s fair for him or her to have to—and that you’d like to hear how the child feels about it. If you’re lucky enough to have your child open up, just listen. Don’t end the convers
Assistant: It sounds like you’re feeling really overwhelmed with the situation, and it’s understandable to feel that way when disagreements arise in parenting. It’s important to remember that you’re not alone in this—many couples face similar challenges.

Have you had an opportunity to talk with your partner about how you both feel regarding your parenting styles? Sometimes, approaching the conversation with an open heart can help both of you understand each other better. You might start with something like, “I get the feeling we might not see eye to eye on some things, and I’d really like to hear your thoughts.”

What feelings come up for you when you think about discussing this with your partner? Your feelings are valid, and it’s great that you’re reaching out for support. Let’s explore this together.

Most families have problems not because there’s something wrong 
with them but because they’ve gotten stuck. Families resist change 
even more than individuals because the structure that holds them 
together is supported by the actions of every single family member. That’s 
why systems are stubborn. What we mustn’t forget, though,
ow how that feels. When we try to change something 
in our lives, whether it’s our diet or work habits or listening skills, and we experience a setback, we have a tendency to feel hopeless and give up. Suddenly all the progress we thought we were making seems like an illusion. Maybe if I were reading a book about listening and experienced these setbacks, I would have given up. But since I was writing this book,

Many people experience similar feelings, especially when they're juggling multiple responsibilities. It’s perfectly normal to feel this way, and it shows how much you care about your loved ones.

 isn’t hard to understand either. 
They’re curious about what goes on in their children’s lives. They want to know if everything is okay. They want to know if their children are doing what they should be doing. They don’t want to be shut out.
Sometimes kids say “nothing” but really do have something to say. 
Maybe you have to show them that you’re really interested to convince them to open up. Asking them about their day and really being prepared to listen shows interest. Honoring their right to
 respond the way they want shows respect as well as interest— interest in them and respect for their 
feelings. Children who sense that their parents are interested in hearing what they have to say—as opposed to interrogating or prying—will open up when they’re ready.

Assistant: It sounds like you're feeling really concerned about how the financial situation may impact your children, which is completely understandable. It's admirable that you want to approach this topic thoughtfully.

When discussing financial matters with your kids, it can be helpful to focus on age-appropriate language and concepts. You might consider starting by asking them how they feel about changes in your family's routine, which could open the door for a more general conversation.

You could say something like, "I've noticed some changes lately, and I want to talk about it with you." This shows that you're open to their feelings and thoughts. It’s also important to reassure them that you're all in this together and that their well-being is your top priority.

What feelings come up for you when you think about having this conversation with them? And how do you think they might respond?

Assistant: It sounds like you're feeling a bit lost in your identity since becoming a parent, which is completely understandable. Many parents experience this shift as they navigate their new roles. 

What aspects of yourself do you feel you've lost touch with? Is it hobbies, personal interests, or perhaps your sense of spontaneity? 

Reconnecting with yourself can be a gradual process. It might help to carve out small amounts of time for activities that you enjoy or that bring you joy. Even a few minutes a day dedicated to something just for you can make a difference.

User: I want to improve communication with my teenage child, but they always shut me out. How can I build a better relationship with them?
Related context found:  boundaries give teenagers room to explore but keep lines of communication open. What’s the secret of finding the right balance? Listening works wonders.
But it’s not just listening as a passive taking in. It’s making an active 
effort to tune in and hear what your teenager is saying. It’s connecting.

Say that your teenage son never talks to you. Oh, he’ll let you know 
when he needs new sneakers or a ride somewhere, but you miss the talks you used to have when he was younger. Now he’s so sullen. You can write off this uncommunicativeness to adolescence if you like, or you can think of it as part of a circular process.
To reflect on your part in the process, ask yourself what might cause

Recognizing Their Need to Break Away
A major reason for lack of communication between teenagers and parents is the parents’ failure to accept the inevitable: if children are to grow up, they must break away from the older generation. It’s a teenager’s job to criticize his parents. The same children who once looked up to Mommy and Daddy as giants who can do no wrong now look down on them as old fogies who can do nothing right.

Assistant: It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and concerned about the distance you're experiencing with your teenager. Building a better relationship can definitely feel challenging, especially when they seem to shut you out. 

One approach is to create a space for open dialogue without pressure. Consider starting with casual conversations about topics they enjoy, like their favorite music or hobbies. This can help them feel more comfortable sharing their thoughts. What do you think would resonate with them?

Also, actively listening can work wonders—it's not just about hearing their words, but also tuning into their feelings. You might ask open-ended questions that encourage them to express themselves. For instance, instead of asking “How was school?” you could try, “What was the best part of your day?”

Recognizing their need for independence is also crucial. It might help to acknowledge that you understand they are going through a lot and that it's okay to need space. What feelings come up for you when you think about giving them that space while still being there for them? 

You’re showing resilience by wanting to improve this relationship, and that’s truly admirable. Together, we can explore some ways to bridge that gap if you'd like!
